    "text": "question\nIsrael has currently (2021) a population of 9.2 million, and a growth rate of 1.8% per year. How long will it take for the population to double, assuming a fixed growth rate?\n\nSuppose you have a process that can be described by exponential growth. It could be anything: interests on an investment, the early phases of infection in a pandemic, whatever.\nIt is often convenient to have an idea how fast is the growth by answering the question:\n\nHow long will it take for \\(x\\) to double in size, given a growth of \\(n\\)% per year?\n\nThe rule of thumb I learned a while back is the following:\n\nDoubling time = \\(\\displaystyle\\frac{70}{n}\\) (in years)\n\nOf course, the time unit could be anything you like, I‚Äôll deal here with years for simplicity‚Äôs sake.\nThe answer to the question about Israel in the box above is about 39 years (70 divided by 1.8), but why?!\nLet‚Äôs call \\(x_0\\) the population size now, and the growth rate \\(n\\)%. After one year, the population will be\n\\[\nx_1 = x_0 \\times \\left( 1 + \\frac{n}{100} \\right).\n\\tag{1}\\]\nAssume that after \\(y\\) years the population will be double, i.e.:\n\\[\nx_k = x_0 \\times \\left( 1 + \\frac{n}{100} \\right)^y = 2x_0.\n\\tag{2}\\]\nCancelling \\(x_0\\) in Equation¬†2 we get\n\\[\n\\left( 1 + \\frac{n}{100} \\right)^y = 2.\n\\tag{3}\\]\nWe now take the natural logarithm of both sides in Equation¬†3, yielding:\n\\[\ny\\ln\\left( 1 + \\frac{n}{100} \\right) = \\ln(2).\n\\tag{4}\\]\nNote that we took \\(y\\) out of the exponent and it now multiplies the logarithm on the left-hand side. Multiplying both sides in Equation¬†4 by 100 yields\n\\[\n100\\,y\\ln\\left( 1 + \\frac{n}{100} \\right) = 100\\ln(2) \\simeq 69.3.\n\\tag{5}\\]\nThat surely explains the number 70 in the rule of thumb! Because of the properties of logarithms, we put the number 100 as the exponent of the parenthesis:\n\\[\ny\\ln\\left( 1 + \\frac{n}{100} \\right)^{100} = 100\\ln(2).\n\\tag{6}\\]\nWe are very close to the end! We now remind ourselves that we learned in Calculus the definition of the exponential function:\n\\[\n\\exp(x) = \\displaystyle\\lim_{m\\rightarrow \\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{x}{m} \\right)^{m}.\n\\tag{7}\\]\nBecause the number 100 is ‚Äúquite big‚Äù, we will approximate the parenthesis inside the logarithm in Equation¬†6 with the exponential function in Equation¬†7, yielding\n\\[\ny\\ln\\exp(n) = 100\\ln(2).\n\\tag{8}\\]\nThe logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential, therefore\n\\[\ny\\,n = \\displaystyle100\\ln(2).\n\\tag{9}\\]\nFinally, solving for \\(y\\), we have\n\\[\ny = \\displaystyle\\frac{100\\ln(2)}{n} \\simeq \\frac{70}{n}.\n\\tag{10}\\]\nWe have thus shown that the number of years \\(y\\) it will take for Israel to double it‚Äôs population is about \\(70/n = 70/1.8 = 38.88\\) years!!\nThe exact number, without any approximations, would be\n\\[\ny = \\displaystyle\\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\ln(1+n/100)}\\simeq 38.85.\n\\tag{11}\\]\n\nconclusion\nüëç Very impressive rule of thumb üëç"

    "section": "",
    "text": "George Hart is again the hero of this project. Go check out his webpage to see how to build this beautiful shape. All you need to make the skewer hyperboloid is a bunch of skewers and thin elastic bands.\nThis is an easy project, and the end result is so fun to play with! It is surprising how smoothly this shape morphes when you pull and push the skewers to change the angle, it‚Äôs hard to explain, so you should definitely try it yourself üòÅ. See Annie Perkins‚Äôs video to get a better idea:\n\n\n\nThe one thing I can add to George Hart‚Äôs page is that after many weeks and months the elastic bands will dry out and break! I gave a skewer hyperboloid to a friend, and one day he arrived at his office and found out that the whole thing had disintegrated overnight, and the skewers were all over the place. I‚Äôm still looking for a suitable substitute to the elastic bands. It must be something flexible that enables us to play with the construction, and at the same time something durable‚Ä¶ I have not found yet the perfect material, if you have a suggestion please write to me.\nI wanted my hyperboloid to last for a long time, so after the construction was done, I used super glue to fix the skewers in a particular angle. Now I can‚Äôt play with it, but at least it will not disintegrate overnight in a few months time (hopefully!).\n\nThe mathematical name of this shape is ‚Äúhyperboloid of one sheet‚Äù, and its equation is\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{x^2}{A^2} + \\frac{y^2}{B^2} - \\frac{z^2}{C^2} = 0.\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nWhen \\(A=B\\) the horizontal cross-sections are circles, just like in our construction. The elastic bands effectively allow us to play with the parameter \\(C\\), which controls how fast the hyperboloid grows sideways. There is a wonderful widget in the Interactive Gallery of Quadric Surfaces, its quite fun to play with.\nTo see how this curved surface can be made entirely out of straight lines, one can define the surface as the set of all parametric curves of the kind\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx &= A (\\cos \\theta - v \\sin \\theta)\\\\\ny &= B (\\sin \\theta + v \\cos \\theta)\\\\\nz &= C \\varepsilon v.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSubstitute the parametric equations above into the equation of the paraboloid and see that they satisfy it.\nThere are actually two families of curves, for \\(\\epsilon=\\pm 1\\). I made a Mathematica plot of the two families of lines, in red (\\(\\varepsilon=1\\)) and in blue (\\(\\varepsilon=-1\\)), for ten \\(\\theta\\) values between 0 and \\(2\\pi\\). It‚Äôs easy to see that each family of lines swirls in a different direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Mathematica code I wrote is\na = 1; b = 1; c = 1; h = 4; n = 10;\np1 = ContourPlot3D[ (*hyperboloid*)   \n   x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 - z^2/c^2 == 1, {x, -h, h}, {y, -h, h}, {z, -h, \n    h},\n   Mesh -&gt; None, ContourStyle -&gt; Opacity[0.4], AxesLabel -&gt; {x, y, z},\n    LabelStyle -&gt; Large\n   ];\np2 = ParametricPlot3D[ (*red lines*)\n   Table[{\n     a (Cos[theta] - v Sin[theta]),\n     b (Sin[theta] + v Cos[theta]),\n     c v\n     }, {theta, 0, 2 Pi, 2 Pi/n}],\n   {v, -20, 20}, PlotStyle -&gt; {Red}\n   ];\np3 = ParametricPlot3D[ (*blue lines*)\n   Table[{\n     a (Cos[theta] - v Sin[theta]),\n     b (Sin[theta] + v Cos[theta]),\n     - c v\n     }, {theta, 0, 2 Pi, 2 Pi/n}],\n   {v, -20, 20}, PlotStyle -&gt; {Blue}\n   ];\nShow[{p1, p2, p3}]"

I actually used Francesco De Comit√©‚Äôs version, also credited by Hart. The idea is that you strategically cut the cards in very specific places, so that they can be slided together.\nFiguring out how to cut the cards was quite hard to me, I had to experiment a lot! George Hart provides printable templates, but their dimensions are different from the cards I used. Finally besides cutting the cards, the task of putting everything together was a nightmare. It‚Äôs been a while since I built this, but I think that I used clothes pegs to hold the cards together before the whole thing is ready. Once you finish building the structure, it should be much more stable (but not enough to throw it in the air!!).\nBecause there is a 5-fold symmetry, naturally the golden ratio\n\\[\\varphi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\]\nfigures quite prominently in there. Francesco De Comit√© provides in his Flickr page a plan for how to cut the cards:\n\nI put the plan above for the future me to understand what it means, because I myself didn‚Äôt use this‚Ä¶ I found in one of my ‚Äúprojects‚Äù folders my own calculations of how to cut the cards. It shows only the cuts on the top side. One should rotate the card 180 degrees and do the same cuts on the other side. For a card of height H and length L, my cutting plan is the following.\n\nThe cuts are the thick blue lines, and the red arrows show the length \\(L/\\varphi\\) of one of the cuts and of the uncut (dashed) part. From this I hope you can imagine that when the cards are slided together, the two cuts amount to the length of the whole ‚Äúdiagonal‚Äù, such that the two card ends are flush.

    "text": "question\nHow does the center of mass of a can of soda vary with the level of the liquid?\n\nThe center of mass of the aluminum can does not change, and assuming that the can is perfectly symmetric, its height should be half of the total can height. Calling the total height \\(L\\), we have that \\(r_\\text{can} = L/2\\).\nAs the soda level in the can goes down, two things happen at the same time:\n\nThe center of mass of the liquid goes linearly from \\(L/2\\) to 0.\nThe mass of the liquid goes linearly to zero as well.\n\nAt the very beginning both centers of mass are at \\(L/2\\), and so is the center of mass of the whole thing. At the end, the liquid is depleted and does not contribute anything to the center of mass, so again the whole system has its center of mass at \\(L/2\\). Can we figure out what equation gives us the total center of mass as a function of the liquid level?\nThe center of mass of the system is given by \\[\nr_{cm}(h) = \\frac{r_\\text{can}\\cdot m_\\text{can} + r_\\text{liq}\\cdot m_\\text{liq}}{m_\\text{can} + m_\\text{liq}},\n\\tag{1}\\] where\n\n\\(m_\\text{can}\\) is the mass of the aluminum can,\n\\(r_\\text{can} = L/2\\) is the center of mass of the aluminum can,\n\\(r_\\text{liq} = h/2\\) is the center of mass of the soda,\n\\(m_\\text{liq} = \\rho \\cdot \\pi R^2 \\cdot h\\) is the mass of the can,\n\\(h\\) is the soda level above the table,\n\\(R\\) is the radius of the can,\n\\(\\rho\\) is the density of the soda.\n\nSubstituting these quantities into Equation¬†1 gives\n\\[\nr_{cm}(h) = \\frac{C \\frac{L}{2} + \\frac{h^2}{2}}{C+h},\n\\tag{2}\\] where the constant \\(C\\) is \\[\nC = \\frac{m_\\text{can}}{\\rho \\cdot \\pi R^2}.\n\\]\nI googled the typical values for a soda can, and got the following:\n\n\\(L = 122\\) mm\n\\(R = 3.31\\) mm\n\\(m_\\text{can} = 14\\) g\n\\(\\rho = 1.026\\) g/mL\n\nSo how does Equation¬†2 look like?\n\nUsing the values above, we find that the lowest value for the center of mass of the whole system is when the soda has a level of only 6.6 mm!

What‚Äôs special about it?\nThe A series starts with A0, which has the nice property of having an area of 1 m\\(^2\\).\n\n\n\nSize\nArea (m¬≤)\n\n\n\n\nA0\n\\(1\\)\n\n\nA1\n\\(1/2\\)\n\n\nA2\n\\(1/4\\)\n\n\nA3\n\\(1/8\\)\n\n\nA4\n\\(1/16\\)\n\n\n\nWe found that the area of an A4 is \\(1/16\\) m\\(^2\\), so now we can write a system of two equations:\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{a}{b} &= \\sqrt{2} \\\\\na \\cdot b &= \\frac{1}{16}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nSolving for \\(a\\) in the first equation gives \\(a=\\sqrt{2}b\\), and substituting this into the second equation gives\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nb^2\\sqrt{2} &= \\frac{1}{16} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow b^2 &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{1}{2^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{1}{2^{\\frac{1}{2}+4}} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow b &= 2^{-\\frac{1}{4}-2}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nand clearly\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\na &= \\sqrt{2}b \\\\\n\\Rightarrow a &= 2^{\\frac{1}{2}}2^{-\\frac{1}{4}-2} = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}-2} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow a &= 2^{\\frac{1}{4}-2} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nTo sum up: \\[\na = 2^{\\frac{1}{4}-2} \\qquad b = 2^{-\\frac{1}{4}-2}\n\\]\n\na = 2**(1/4-2)   # in meters\nb = 2**(-1/4-2)  # in meters\nprint(f\"a={1000*a:.0f} mm, b={1000*b:.0f} mm\")\nprint(\"Check out the exact values in the figure at the top of this post\")\n\na=297 mm, b=210 mm\nCheck out the exact values in the figure at the top of this post\n\n\nAnd this, my friends, concludes today‚Äôs exercise :)"
