What's A0?\n\nNow that we found the proportion of the A series, we can ask a follow up:\n\n**Question: Why does the A4 have this specific size? What's special about it?**\n\nThe A series starts with A0, which has the nice property of having an area of 1 m$^2$.\n\n| Size | Area (mÂ²) |\n|------|-----------|\n| A0   | $1$       |\n| A1   | $1/2$     |\n| A2   | $1/4$     |\n| A3   | $1/8$     |\n| A4   | $1/16$    |\n\nWe found that the area of an A4 is $1/16$ m$^2$, so now we can write a system of two equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{a}{b} &= \\sqrt{2} \\\\\na \\cdot b &= \\frac{1}{16}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nSolving for $a$ in the first equation gives $a=\\sqrt{2}b$, and substituting this into the second equation gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nb^2\\sqrt{2} &= \\frac{1}{16} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow b^2 &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}\\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{1}{2^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\cdot 2^4} = \\frac{1}{2^{\\frac{1}{2}+4}} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow b &= 2^{-\\frac{1}{4}-2}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nand clearly\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\na &= \\sqrt{2}b \\\\\n\\Rightarrow a &= 2^{\\frac{1}{2}}2^{-\\frac{1}{4}-2} = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}-2} \\\\\n\\Rightarrow a &= 2^{\\frac{1}{4}-2} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nTo sum up:\n$$\na = 2^{\\frac{1}{4}-2} \\qquad b = 2^{-\\frac{1}{4}-2}\n$$\n\n::: {#b860cc23 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = 2**(1/4-2)   # in meters\nb = 2**(-1/4-2)  # in meters\nprint(f\"a={1000*a:.0f} mm, b={1000*b:.0f} mm\")\nprint(\"Check out the exact values in the figure at the top of this post\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\na=297 mm, b=210 mm\nCheck out the exact values in the figure at the top of this post\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd this, my friends, concludes today's exercise :)\n\n",
