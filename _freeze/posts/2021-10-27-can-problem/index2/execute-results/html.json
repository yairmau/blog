Calling the total height $L$, we have that $r_\\text{can} = L/2$.\n\nAs the soda level in the can goes down, two things happen at the same time:\n\n1. The center of mass of the liquid goes linearly from $L/2$ to 0.\n2. The mass of the liquid goes linearly to zero as well.\n\nAt the very beginning both centers of mass are at $L/2$, and so is the center of mass of the whole thing.\nAt the end, the liquid is depleated and does not contribute anything to the center of mass, so again the whole system has its center of mass at $L/2$. Can we figure out what equation gives us the total center of mass as a function of the liquid level?\n\nThe center of mass of the system is given by\n$$\nr_{cm} = \\frac{r_\\text{can}\\cdot m_\\text{can} + r_\\text{liq}\\cdot m_\\text{liq}}{m_\\text{can} + m_\\text{liq}},\n$$ {#eq-center-of-mass1}\nwhere\n\n* $m_\\text{can}$ is the mass of the aluminum can,\n* $r_\\text{can} = L/2$ is the center of mass of the aluminum can,\n* $r_\\text{liq} = h/2$ is the center of mass of the soda,\n* $m_\\text{liq} = \\rho \\cdot \\pi R^2 \\cdot h$ is the mass of the can,\n* $h$ is the soda level above the table,\n* $R$ is the radius of the can,\n* $\\rho$ is the density of the soda.\n\nSubstituting these quantities into @eq-center-of-mass1 gives\n\n$$\nr_{cm} = \\frac{C \\frac{L}{2} + \\frac{h^2}{2}}{C+h},\n$$ {#eq-center-of-mass-simple}\nwhere the constant $C$ is\n$$\nC = \\frac{m_\\text{can}}{\\rho \\cdot \\pi R^2}.\n$$\n\nI googled the typical values for a soda can, and got the following:\n\n* $L = 122$ mm\n* $R = 3.31$ mm\n* $m_\\text{can} = 14$ g\n* $\\rho = 1.026$ g/mL\n\nSo how does @eq-center-of-mass-simple look like?\n\n![](can_graph.png)\n\nUsing the values above, we find that the lowest value for the center of mass of the whole system is when the soda has a level of only 6.6 mm!\nThis is when the can should be less likely to topple, because the center of mass is so low (relative the the total mass).\n\nI'll finish by copying here the Python code I used to produce the graph above.\n\nImport a bunch of packages.\n\n::: {#b04e07a6 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set(style=\"ticks\", font_scale=1.5)\nfrom sympy import symbols, diff, solve\nfrom sympy.abc import x\n```\n:::\n\n\nDefine the problem parameters, and find the lowest center of mass.\n\n::: {#daeead23 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nL = 122.0 # mm\nR = 3.31 # mm\nMcan = 14 # g\nrho_soda = 1.026 # g/mL\nC = Mcan / (rho_soda * np.pi * R**2)\nh = np.linspace(0, L, 1001)\n\ndef RCM(H):\n    return (C*L/2 + H**2/2) / (C+H)\nRcm = RCM(h)\n\n# Convert the function to a symbolic expression\nexpr = RCM(x)\n# Take the derivative\nf_prime = diff(expr, x)\n# Solve for x where the derivative equals zero\nsolutions = solve(f_prime, x)\n# Print the solutions\nprint(f\"We found {len(solutions):d} solutions: \", solutions)\n# choose the physically relevant solution\nh_min= solutions[1]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nWe found 2 solutions:  [-7.36225033226790, 6.56937517541552]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPlot.\n\n::: {#c8e18cc2 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1)\nax.plot(h, Rcm, lw=2)\nax.annotate(f\"can is less likely to topple when\\nlevel = {h_min:.1f} mm\",\n            xy=(h_min, RCM(h_min)), xycoords='data',\n            xytext=(15, 50), textcoords='data',\n            size=16,\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=\"->\",\n                            connectionstyle=\"arc3\",\n                            color=\"black\"),\n            )\nax.set(\n    xlabel=\"soda level (mm)\",\n    ylabel=\"center of mass (mm)\",\n    ylim=[0,L/2+5],\n    title=\"center of mass of a can of soda partially full\")\nfig.savefig(\"can_graph.png\", bbox_inches='tight', dpi=300)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index2_files/figure-html/cell-4-output-1.png){width=606 height=476}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
